Description: Ptmdb is a MySQL database designed to contain large datasets of
    post-translational modifications (PTMs). The database tries to standarize
    the complexity of the PTM data by integrating the multiple biological and
    technical concepts under the same framework. This package contains a number
    of common R functions that can be useful when working with the ptmdb
    database.
